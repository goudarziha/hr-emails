# Mass HR Email Sender

When you need to send massive amounts of emails to HR for no specific reason.

## Description

This will create a dynamic email address based on your current gmail account, appending your existing email with (+1,+2,+3...) for how many e-mails you need to send. Will help get it pass some spam filters, but not guaranteed to pass. If you're like me and can't remember what you did yesterday, this will autocomplete your tasks for last week, as well as a fake name. Feel free to change as you want.
